# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few quick guidelines to get started.

- Report bugs by opening an issue with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and environment details.
- For code changes, open a pull request against the `master` branch. Keep PRs small and focused.
- Follow existing code style (JavaScript/TypeScript/Go conventions). Add tests for new behavior when practical.
- Be respectful and constructive in discussion. This project follows the standard open-source etiquette.

If you'd like help picking a first issue, leave a comment on an open issue or reach out via social links in the `README.md`.
